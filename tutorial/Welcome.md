# Welcome to the Machine Learning Platform

Our goal is to provide an out-of-the-box working platform for most machine learning needs of high energy physics and astrophysics.
Each Jupyter instance has a shared storage space in the directory labeled `/data/`. The source for these tutorials is in [GitHub here](https://github.com/ivukotic/ML_platform_tests/tree/master/tutorial).

Each instance should be considered transient so if you want to keep your code, have a copy elsewhere (locally on your computer, github,...).

Jupyter comes with Python3.8 and ROOT kernels.
ROOT 6.24 is installed in default location.

Most of ML libraries are installed. If you need additial packages feel free to install them using `pip3 install xxx` command. If you think the missing package would be of wider use please contact Ilija Vukotic <mailto:ivukotic@cern.ch> and we will consider it for inclusion.

In case anything is messed up with your Jupyter instance let us know and we will recreate it (you would loose all the data). The new instance will be accessible at the same address as the old one.
