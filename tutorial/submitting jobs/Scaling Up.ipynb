    "\n",
    "To harness to full abilities of distributed high throughput computing on the OSG, it is necessary to learn how to scale up and control large numbers of jobs. This requires the ability to submit and process multiple jobs in parallel. Examples of workloads that require these considerations include multi-dimensional Monte Carlo integration using sampling, parameter sweep(s) for a given model, and molecular dynamics simulation with several initial conditions. All of these workloads require submitting more than a handful of jobs. \n",

    "The HTCondor submit file keyword `queue` can run multiple jobs from a single job description file. In this tutorial, we will see how to scale up the calculations for a simple Python example using the `queue` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand the basic HTCondor script to run a single job, it is easy to scale up.\n",

    "## Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to use a brute force approach to finding the minimum/maximum (also known as \"optimiziation\") of a two dimensional function on a grid of points. Let us take a look at the function (also known as the objective function) that we are trying to optimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = (1 - x)**2 + (y - x**2)**2\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the two dimensional Rosenbrock function, which is used to test the robustness of an optimization method. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Python script will randomly select the boundary values of the grid that the optimization procedure will scan over. These values can be overridden by user supplied values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-ScalingUp-Python/master/Images/RosenBrockFunction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the calculation with random boundary values, the script is executed without any argument\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $ module load python/3.4\n",
    "    $ module load all-pkgs\n",
    "    $ python rosen_brock_brute_opt.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "To run the calculation with the user-supplied boundary values, the script is executed with input arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "    python rosen_brock_brute_opt.py x_low x_high y_low y_high\n",
    "\n",
    "where `x_low` and `x_high` are low and high values along x-direction, and `y_low` and `y_high` are the low and high values along the y-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to set the boundary in the x-direction as (-3, 3) and the boundary in the y-direction as (-2, 2), run\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python rosen_brock_brute_opt.py -3 3 -2 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The directory `Example1` runs the Python script with the default random values. The directories `Example2`, `Example3` and `Example4` deal with supplying the boundary values as input arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at the execution script, `cat scalingup-python-wrapper.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/bin/bash\n",
