    "## Overview \n",
    "In this section, we will learn the basics of HTCondor for submitting and monitoring jobs. The jobs are submitted through the OSG Connect login node. The submitted jobs are executed on the remote worker node(s) and the outputs are transfered back to the login node. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Login to OSG Connect\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still logged in from the previous lesson, you can continue to the next section. Otherwise, please login using SSH:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# username is your username\n",
    "$ ssh username@training.osgconnect.net  \n",
    "# enter your password\n",
    "password:                            \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may receive a warning such as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The authenticity of host 'training.osgconnect.net (192.170.227.119)' can't be established.\n",
    "RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:KRH0+kF1V5kNookplCt2f+lH4dKaZLowKbEevNnVmKY.\n",
    "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is normal when connecting to a new host for the first time. If prompted, type `yes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Job execution script\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `tutorial` command, we will get the relevant example files. Run the `quickstart` tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# creates a directory \"tutorial-quickstart\".\n",
    "$ tutorial quickstart \n",
    "# relevant script and input files are inside this directory\n",
    "$ cd ~/tutorial-quickstart \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at two files in detail: `short.sh` and `tutorial01.submit`. You can use your favorite text editor, we will be using `cat`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cat short.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "# short.sh: a short discovery job\n",
    "printf \"Start time: \"; /bin/date\n",
    "printf \"Job is running on node: \"; /bin/hostname\n",
    "printf \"Job running as user: \"; /usr/bin/id\n",
    "printf \"Job is running in directory: \"; /bin/pwd\n",
    "echo\n",
    "echo \"Working hard...\"\n",
    "sleep 10\n",
    "echo \"Science complete!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, make the script executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ chmod +x short.sh \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we used the tutorial command, all files are already in your workspace. Run the job locally when setting up a new job type, it is important to test your job outside of HTCondor before submitting into the Open Science Grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./short.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Start time: Mon Mar  6 00:08:06 CST 2017\n",

    "## Job submission file\n",
    "The HTCondor submit file describes the job requirements, how to execute the program, and what (small) input/output data needs to be transfered.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cat tutorial01.submit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# The UNIVERSE defines an execution environment. You will almost always use \"vanilla\". \n",
    "Universe = vanilla \n",
    "\n",
    "# EXECUTABLE is the program your job will run. It's often useful to create a shell script to \"wrap\" your actual work. \n",
    "Executable = short.sh \n",
    "\n",
    "# ERROR and OUTPUT are the error and output channels from your job that HTCondor returns from the remote host.\n",
    "Error = job.error\n",
    "Output = job.output\n",
    "\n",
    "# The LOG file is where HTCondor places information about your  job's status, success, and resource consumption. \n",
    "Log = job.log\n",
    "\n",
    "# Queue is the \"start button\" - it launches any jobs that have been  specified thus far. \n",
    "Queue 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Job submission\n",
    "Submit the job using `condor_submit`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ condor_submit tutorial01.submit\n",
    "Submitting job(s).\n",
    "1 job(s) submitted to cluster 1144.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Job status\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condor_q` command tells the status of currently running jobs. Please note, that the `condor_q` command line interface has changed in recent HTCondor versions, and in this tutorial we are using the new version.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's wait for your job to finish – that is, for `condor_q` not to show the job in its output. A useful tool for this is watch – it runs a program repeatedly, letting you see how the output differs at fixed time intervals.
